# Spring_Demo

I shoot for stars,I plan before starting, define some milestones and make efforts. 
I would never give up. At each milestone, I review, analyse and take the best 
strategy and go on to meet the goal. I am self disciplined and self motivated.
Call me knowledgeable, firm, uncompromising, and soaring.

Project Requirement:
I will add this part later
jdk1.8.0_181
spring 5.1.1
tomact 8.5


Description:

In this project I gradually implement whatever I learn about Spring 5.0
I began with a simple project and I gradually go forward by the course 

Spring Hibernate Tutorial by Chad Darby
on https://www.udemy.com/spring-hibernate-tutorial
 
I enjoy coding and learning. The IDE which is used by Chad is Eclipse while
I am more convenient to use my favourite IDE Intellij Idea Ultimate 2018.02 
so that makes me to be familiar with both ;)

Here I list the task I am doing step by step

Spring Core
Done:
-Config Log Level to be printed by Tomcat
-Inversion of Control using ApplicationContext.xml
-Constructor-based dependency injection
-Setter-based dependency injection
